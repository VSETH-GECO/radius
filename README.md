# FreeRADIUS

## Structure

The setup is IMO a bit confusing, so this parts should clarify things.

* `conf`: Containg PolyLAN specific configuration
  * `radiusd.conf`/`default`/`inner-tunnel`/`eap`/`sql`: Your normal config files
  * `clients.conf`: Only in this repo included for documentation purpose, but is overwritten on startup, see `k8s`. It contains the switches.
* `bootstrap.sh`: Glues all the special cases from above together.

For development purposes:

* `init`: Sets up the local database
* `scripts`: Included the script, that are responsible for overwriting `authorize`/`clients.conf` on startup

## Synopsis

The RADIUS server is essentially configured to accept any authentication request and send back the `Tunnel-Private-Group-Id := 499` attribute to assign the user's port to VLAN 499 on the user switch.

In VLAN 499, the user is presented the network login page provided by login-ng (dedicated app)

After a successful login, login-ng creates a bouncer (dedicated app) job that reassigns the user to the VLAN dedicated to the user switch to which the user is plugged in to.

This works because the bounder can access the freeradius database. On an authentication request, freeradius looks up the attributes for a specific username in the `radreply` table. The bouncer edits this table, if a user should be relocated to a different VLAN and also triggers re-authentication of the client via Change-of-Authorization (CoA).

Moreover, the bouncer sets the `Cleartext-Password` for a user (identified by its MAC) to its MAC (username == password) via the `radcheck` table (not sure how this is used though).

Presumably, the user switch uses PAP to authenticate with freeradius, as there is nothing explicitly configured in the user switch.

Honestly, I think most of the custom configured described in the next section can be trashed.

## What is configured?

In general, the configuration files are a modified version of the [default configuration files](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/tree/release_3_2_0/raddb).

* `radiusd.conf`
  * log to `stdout`
  * log all (accept and reject) auth results
* `default`
  * disable IPv6 listeners
  * disable various username validators in `authorize` (`filter_username`, `chap`, `mschap`, `digest`, `-ldap`)
  * but we also add a validator, that accepts any authentication request (probably because of our setup with login-ng and bouncer):

    ```text
        if (!control:Cleartext-Password && User-Password) {
            update control {
                    Cleartext-Password := "%{User-Password}"
                    # Dummy value, will not be sent:
                    Tunnel-Private-Group-ID := "499"
            }
    }
    ```

  * disable authentication modules, matching the disabled authorization modules
  * enable `sql` authentication backend
  * disable some accounting options (`detailed`, `unix`)
* `eap`
  * set `default_eap_type = ttls`
  * enable caching for Session resumption / fast reauthentication
  * set `default_eap_type = mschapv2` in ttls (tunneled tls)
* `inner-tunnel`
  * disable more authorization modules as above (`chap`, `-ldap`, `pap`)
  * same for the authentication modules
  * enable sql
* `sql`
  * set `dialect = "mysql"`
  * set `driver = "rlm_sql_${dialect}"`
  * disable tls with mysql db
  * set db coordinates via env vars (server, port, database, user, password)
  * set `read_groups = no`
  * set `read_profiles = yes`
  * set `read_clients = yes`

## Run locally

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Testing

In the local setup, there is a client and a user configured:

`clients.conf`:

```text
client dockernet {
 ipaddr = 127.0.0.1/8
 secret = testing123
}
```

`mods-config/files/authorize`:

```text
bob Cleartext-Password := "test"
```

Run (within the container):

```bash
âžœ docker exec -it freeradius bash
root@68babbd2d9f0:/# radtest bob test 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
Sent Access-Request Id 3 from 0.0.0.0:48770 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 73
        User-Name = "bob"
        User-Password = "test"
        NAS-IP-Address = 172.20.0.3
        NAS-Port = 0
        Message-Authenticator = 0x00
        Cleartext-Password = "test"
Received Access-Accept Id 3 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 127.0.0.1:48770 length 20
```
